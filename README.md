# PROXYGEN2.0
Robotic arm in ros2 humble. To use this package, make sure you've installed ros2 humble and gazebo ignition from the official source. We've used joint position controllers for the arm which works well only when you've installed the recommended gazebo version for ros2 humble. 

Make sure you've installed the following packages:

[ROS2_Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html)

[Gazebo Ignition](https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/install_ubuntu/)

- Install ros-gz:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-ros-gz
```

- Install ros2 controllers:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-ros2-controllers ros-humble-ros2-control
```

- Install ignition control:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-ign-ros2-control
```


## Clone this repo into your worksapce, if you don't have a ros workspace yet, create one:

```
cd ~
mkdir -p robotic_arm_ws/src
cd robotic_arm_ws/src
```
- or in your custom workspace src folder, clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/rajeev-gupta-bashrc/PROXYGEN2.0.git
cd ..
colcon build
```

- add the source command in .bashrc file:
```
echo 'source ~/robotic_arm_ws/install/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Visualize the Robot:
- install urdf-tutorial package

```
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-urdf-tutorial
```

- run this code in a new terminal
```
ros2 launch urdf_tutorial display.launch.py model:=$HOME/robotic_arm_ws/src/PROXYGEN2.0/proxygen_description/xacro/proxygen.full.xacro
```

- You'll also see a small window of sliders which can be used to change the angles of the robotic arm joints. 


## Launch robot in Gazebo:

```
ros2 launch proxygen_description gazebo.launch.py 
```

![Robot in Action](https://github.com/rajeev-gupta-bashrc/PROXYGEN2.0/blob/main/images/arm_gazebo.png)

- Note: Gazebo will launch in paused mode by default. If you don't want to launch it in paused mode, run this:
```
ros2 launch proxygen_description gazebo.launch.py paused:=False
```

## Launch arm with controllers:

```
ros2 launch proxygen_control proxygen_ros2_control.launch.py
```

- List ros2 topics available:

```
ros2 topic list
```

- Send commands to the arm: We'll pass an array of 6 float values which are the joint angles/positions for the arm.

```
ros2 topic pub /joint_position_controller/commands  std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray "{data: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}"
```
